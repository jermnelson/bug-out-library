    	<h1>Suitcase Library</h1>
        <blockquote>
          What happens if we have to recreate our culture and civilization from a portable
          library? What if we were all refugees from some calamity and all we had to bootstrap
          ourselves in a constrained, transportable physical object? What should be in that?
        </blockquote> 
        <p>
           An ongoing art project in creating an "end-of-world" or a "bug out bag" library of 
           conventional and electronic resources, all constrained by the size of medium roller suitcase.
